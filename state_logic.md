# Logic for flight states

## Idle
Az~g, Ax~0, Ay~0, Altitude~const

## Liftoff
Az suddenly increases, Altitude starts increasing at increasing rate

## Powered Ascent and Coasting
Az is high and suddenly changes to g in opp. direction, altitude increasing

## Apogee
altitude reaches maxima, low velocity, accn g towards the ground

## Drogue Chute
sudden jerk, velocity increases till terminal

## Main Chute
sudden, much larger jerk, velocity decreases drastically

## Touchdown
sudden acceleration, then normal with ~0 velocity
